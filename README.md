# Basic calculator ðŸ–©

Here we have a basic calculator which implements the more javascript than any other project I have completed so far.
Although alot of the code was basic math operations it still took me some time to get correct.

I am aware most people will be familure with what a calculator is and does so I will explain some of what code went into creating this project.

- First I used a HTML table with a text input field for the screen
- I then created 5 rows with 4 td elements per row for the buttons
- I then styled the page to make the buttons appear 3d and imitate a downword motion when being pressed
- Using % with relative sizing such as width allowed the page to become resonsive
- Javascript was a massive part of this project mainly using math operations, switch statements and if else statements
- I also created some hidden variables to store values when the user pressed the math input they required. this allowed for the screen to be given a value of 0 ready for the next user input.
